Reactions process the stream of query result changes output by one or more Continuous Queries and act on them.

The action taken depends on the Reaction type being used. Drasi currently provides the following Reactions:

- [Azure Event Grid](#event-grid-reaction), to forward Continuous Query results to Azure Event Grid, which in turn enables integration with any application, service, or function that can receive updates from Azure Event Grid.
- [Debug](#debug-reaction), a tool to help developers inspect the results generated by Continuous Queries.
- [SignalR](#signalr-reaction), to forward Continuous Query results to Web Applications.
- [Gremlin](#gremlin-reaction), to use the Continuous Query results as parameters to commands that run against a Gremlin database.
- [Dataverse](#dataverse-reaction), to use the Continuous Query results as parameters to commands that run against a Microsoft Dataverse entities.
