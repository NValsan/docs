    What are Sources and How to Use Them
---

Sources provide connectivity to the systems that Drasi can observe as sources of change. Sources perform three important functions within Drasi:
- Process the change log/feed generated by the source system and push those changes to each [Continuous Query](/solution-developer/components/continuous-queries) that uses that Source as input.
- Translate source change data into a consistent property graph data model so that subscribed Continuous Queries can use that data as if it where a graph of Nodes and Relations. For graph sources, such as Gremlin, no translation is necessary. But for non-graph sources, such as PostgreSQL and Kubernetes, the Source transforms the data (more detail is provided in the individual Sources sections below).
- Provide a way for Continuous Queries to query the source system at startup to initialize the state of the Continuous Query result.

Drasi currently provides Sources for the following source systems:

- [Azure Cosmos DB Gremlin API](#azure-cosmos-db-gremlin-api-source)
- [PostgreSQL](#postgresql-source)
- [SQL Server](#sqlserver-source)
- [Event Hubs](#event-hubs-source)
- [Dataverse](#dataverse-source)
- [Kubernetes](#kubernetes-source) (experimental)

## Creation
Sources can be created and managed using the `drasi` CLI. 

The easiest way to create a Source, and the way you will often create one as part of a broader software solution, is to:

1. Collect credentials and endpoint addresses that provide access to the change log and query API of the source system you want to connect to.
2. Create a YAML file containing the Source resource definition. This will include the configuration settings that enable the Source to connect to the source system. This file can be stored in your solution repo and versioned along with all the other solution code / resources.
3. Run `drasi apply` to apply the Source resource definition to the Kubernetes cluster where your Drasi environment is deployed.

As soon as the Source is created it will start running, monitoring its source system for changes and pushing them to subscribed Continuous Queries.

The definition for a Source has the following basic structure:

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Source
name: <id>
spec:
  kind: <type>
  properties:
    (source kind specific fields)...
```
The following table describes these configuration settings:

|Name|Description|
|-|-|
|apiVersion|Must have the value **v1**|
|kind|Must have the value **Source**|
|name|The **id** of the Source. Must be unique within the scope of the Sources in the Drasi deployment. The  **id** is used to identify the Source through the CLI/API and in a Continuous Query definitions to identify which Sources the Continuous Query subscribes to for change events.|
|spec.kind|The type of Source to create, which defines the type of database or source system the Source connects to. Must be one of [CosmosGremlin](#azure-cosmos-db-gremlin-api-source), [PostgreSQL](#postgresql-source) or [Kubernetes](#kubernetes-source).|
|spec.properties.*|The configuration settings passed to the Source as name-value pairs. Properties differ depending on the Source type (**spec.kind**). See the individual Source sections below for the properties required by each Source type.  Any of these properties can either be specified inline or reference a secret. eg. 
```yaml
  kind: PostgreSQL
  properties:
    user: my-user
    password:
      kind: Secret
      name: pg-creds
      key: password
```

Once configured, to create a Source defined in a file called `source.yaml`, you would run the command:

```
drasi apply -f source.yaml
```

You can then use the standard `drasi` commands to query the existence and status of the Source resource. For example, to see a list of the active Sources, run the following command:

```
drasi list source
```

## Deletion
To delete an active Source, run the following command:

```
drasi delete source <id>
```

For example, if the Source ID is `human-resources`, you would run,

```
drasi delete source human-resources
```

**Note**: Drasi does not currently enforce dependency integrity between Sources and Continuous Queries. If you delete a Source that is used by one or more Continuous Queries, they will stop getting change events and stop producing results.

## Configuring Sources
The following sections describe the configuration of the Source types currently supported by Drasi.

- [Azure Cosmos DB Gremlin API](#azure-cosmos-db-gremlin-api-source)
- [PostgreSQL](#postgresql-source)
- [Kubernetes](#kubernetes-source) (experimental)

### Azure Cosmos DB Gremlin API Source

### PostgreSQL Source

### SQLServer Source

### Event Hubs Source

### Dataverse Source



### Kubernetes Source
The Kubernetes Source is an early stage experimental Source that enables Drasi connectivity to Kubernetes clusters, enabling Drasi to support Continuous Queries that incorporate changes to Kubernetes resources.

#### Source Requirements

You will need a client side credentials that can be used to authenticate against your Kubernetes cluster and has permission to watch resources.

#### Configuration Settings
The following is an example of a full resource definition for a Kubernetes Source using Kubernetes Secrets to securely store credentials:

To get the credentials, export the Kubernetes credentials to a file named `credentials.yaml`

- For self hosted clusters, you can find this in your [kubeconfig](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/organize-cluster-access-kubeconfig/) file
- For AKS, you can use this command
```
az aks get-credentials --resource-group <resource group> --name <cluster name> --file credentials.yaml
```

Create a secret named `k8s-context` from the `credentials.yaml` file

```bash
kubectl create secret generic k8s-context --from-file=credentials.yaml
```

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Source
name: k8s
spec:
  kind: Kubernetes
  properties:
    kubeconfig:
      kind: Secret
      name: k8s-context
      key: credentials.yaml
```

In the Source resource definition:
- **apiVersion** must be **v1**
- **kind** must be **Source**
- **name** is the **id** of the Source and must be unique. This id is used in a Continuous Query definitions to identify which Sources the Continuous Query subscribes to for change events.
- **spec.kind** must be **Kubernetes**

The following table describes the properties that must be configured in the **spec** object:
|Property|Description|
|-|-|
|kubeconfig|A [kubeconfig](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/organize-cluster-access-kubeconfig) containing the credentials to connect to your cluster|

#### Data Transformation

Currently, only Pods and Containers are projected onto a graph schema.  The relation between them is labeled `HOSTS` and flows from the `Pod` to the `Container`.  A MATCH cypher clause that connects these would look as follows

```cypher
MATCH (p:Pod)-[:HOSTS]->(c:Container) 
```

The following properties are projected to the graph nodes

|Node Label|Property|Origin|
|-|-|-|
|Container|name|Pod.status.containerStatuses[].name|
|Container|image|Pod.status.containerStatuses[].image|
|Container|started|Pod.status.containerStatuses[].started|
|Container|ready|Pod.status.containerStatuses[].ready|
|Container|restartCount|Pod.status.containerStatuses[].restartCount|
|Container|state|Pod.status.containerStatuses[].state|
|Container|message|Pod.status.containerStatuses[].state.message|
|Container|reason|Pod.status.containerStatuses[].state.reason|
|Container|terminationMessage|Pod.status.containerStatuses[].lastState.terminated.message|
|Pod|name|Pod.metadata.name|
|Pod|podIP|Pod.status.podIP|
|Pod|phase|Pod.status.phase|
|Pod|message|Pod.status.message|
|Pod|hostIP|Pod.status.hostIP|
|Pod|reason|Pod.status.reason|
